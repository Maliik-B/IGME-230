My Project!
===========

My game proposal is a simple bubble shooter game where the player's main
objective is to knock down all the bubbles presented on one's screen
with a limited amount of balls. My spin on this is that there will be up
to four cannons positioned around the map and the player will have to
switch between these four to fire their shots.\
An example of a bubble shooter is shown below:

Bubble Fury!
============

High Concept
------------

As mentioned on the main page my game will be a re-imagination of the
classic bubble shooter game, with multiple shooting areas and powerup to
keep the game interesting.

Genre
-----

This is a shooter/puzzle game.

Platform
--------

This will be released for Desktop only

Story
-----

This game has no story and is purely for the satisfaction of winning
levels!

Esthetics
---------

The game would have light ambiance and a childlike vibe to it. The
sounds and feel when hitting different bubbles should be very
satisfying. An ocean theme would be seen throughout the game.
